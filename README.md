# interactive-resume

Simple interactive resume using HTML5, CSS3 and JQuery.
The idea is to let the recruiter type any letter on his keyboard to give him a keyword corresponding to the letter he pressed.

The code has been made for a job @MEI in the HEIG-VD in Yverdon (switzerland).

The code is free for use. Just modify the the content and display to use your own style and not a simple copy-paste.

Feel free to work on the code and improve it. Together we can make incredible things :D
